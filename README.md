# Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes  

* This is a guided project from DataQuest
* In this project I have made a spam filter based on Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.

# Results  
In this project, we managed to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The filter had an accuracy of **95.24%** on the test set, which is an excellent result. We initially aimed for an accuracy of over 80%, but we managed to do way better than that.
